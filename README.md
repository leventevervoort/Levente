### World Music and the Grammy's
Since 1992, the Grammy for Best World Music Album is awarded. From 2004 to 2011 the Award was suspended and a Best Contemporary and Best Traditional Award were handed out instead. 'World music' is a highly problematic genre label. It is an  umbrella term used primarily by the capitalist music industry to commodify a variety of musical styles and crossovers that are exoticized as non-traditional, folk, ethnic, indigenous or otherwise Other to Western popular music. For a more elaborate discussions from musicological and interdisciplinary perspective, please confer

My corpus will consist of all the nominated albums for these three awards. Although the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences (NARAS), who hand out the Grammy's, have labelled all these albums 'world music', a quick browse through my corpus shows a diversity of musical styles from all over the world, acoustic and amplified, vocal and instrumental, with artists singing in English and native languages and so on. Noticeable, too, is the fact that being nominated once improved artists likelihood of receiving a nomation again. Thus, even though a variety of artists from different musical traditions were nominated over the years, NARAS seems to return to the same artist time and again. Ladysmith Black Mambazo, for example, was, interestingly, nominated five times for the World Music Grammy's (two wins), twice for the Traditional (won both) and twice for the Contemporary (no wins).

Before looking into the data made available to us, we might already pose some questions relating to the nominees. 
#### Do the winning albums have any features in common when compared to the other nominees?
#### Do the data provide any characteristics that support the different between contemporary and traditional world music?
#### Is there anything that we might noticeably call 'world music' about these albums, if we compare them to non-nominated music from their respective genres? 

To answer the last question, of course, we must determine the more narrowly-defined genre labels that fit the artists' music. For this, I will use everynoise.com. Brazilian artist Gilberto Gil, for example, who was nominated for the World Music Award four times and the Contemporary Award thrice, is listed by Every Noise under bossa nova, música popular brasileira, violão, samba, forro and pagode. Tinariwen, a Tuareg group from Mali, is listed by Every Noise under the label world, but also under the labels desert blues, musique touareg, afropop, malian blues, western saharan folk, mande pop and afrobeat. Every Noise's genre labels are all more specific than world music, either geographically or style-wise.

Let me now introduce the playlists in Spotify I compiled to create my corpus.

For the Grammy for Best World Music Album, every year, one winner was chosen out of five nominees. In 1997, six albums were nominated. In 2014, four albums were nominated and two albums won the Award ex aequo. I have created a playlist on Spotify that consists of all the nominated albums. In total, this amounts to 1094 songs divided among 111 albums.The Spotify URI for the playlist is: spotify:playlist:3F31WIjR3RI11VVTybMKOX

Three albums were completely unavailable, namely:

* King Sunny Adé - Odu (1999)
* Daniel Ho- On a Gentle Island Breeze (2012)
* Wu Man, Luis Conte & Daniel Ho – Our World in Song (2015)

Some albums were only available in parts. Songs from these albums were loaded into the playlist by Spotify from the respective artists' other albums. I will need to consider how to deal with this once I start analyzing the data more in-depth.

I also created a playlist that contains the nominees for Best Contemporary World Music Album, that consists of 36 albums and a total of 536 tracks. The Spotify URI for this playlist is spotify:playlist:2D5oiBpDIHydwu3CD2RLmg

Four albums were unavailable on Spotify, to wit:

* Youssou N'Dour - Nothing's in Vain (Coono du Reer) (2004)
* Bela Fleck - 	Throw Down Your Heart: Tales from the Acoustic Planet, Vol. 3 - Africa Sessions (2010)
* Omar Sosa - Across the Divide: A Tale of Rhythm & Ancestry (2010)

A third playlist contains the nominees for Best Traditional World Music Album, it contains 36 albums and 377 tracks. The corresponding URI is: spotify:playlist:53ok0k7e3IczS3CxdZ2jVj

These albums were unavailable:

* Perú Negro - Jolgorio (2005)
* Masters of Persian Music - Faryad (2006)
* John Santos Y El Coro Folklórico - La Guerra No (2010)
* Ten Drum Art Percussion Group - Drum Music Land (2010)

### Preliminary Findings

#### Comparing winners and nominess
I first compared the Best World Music Album winning albums to the other nominated albums. No significat differences arose from this comparison. For example, the mean dancebility for  the winning albums was 0.568 with a standard deviation of 0.150, while the nominated albums on average scored a dancebility of 0.535 with s= 0.160. The other Spotify features I documented displayed differences that similarly fell within the respective standard deviations of their categories.

#### Comparing contemporary and traditional world music
A first comparison between the nominees for the Contemporary World Music and Traditional World Music Awards that were handed out between 2004 and 2011 yielded more interesting results. Below are the averages (upper number) and standard deviations (lower) for six of Spotify's documentable features for the two playlists (danceability, energy, speechiness, acousticness, instrumentalness and valence):

##### Tradtional

  Da    En     Sp    Ac    In    Va
  
 0.471 0.374 0.0834 0.810 0.220 0.517
 0.146 0.191 0.0988 0.174 0.344 0.275
 
###### Contemporary

Dan   Ene    Spe   Aco   Ins   Val
 
0.590 0.545 0.0680 0.588 0.135 0.566
0.152 0.240 0.0782 0.287 0.273 0.263

We see that the nominees for the contemporary award were on average more danceable and had higher energy, two features that we might expect are intertwined in a a way, supposing high energy tracks are more danceable. Nominees for the traditional award were on average significantly more acoustic than their contemporary counterparts. Perhaps one way NARAS differentiated between the two monikers was to look at the use of amplified instrumentation, electr(on)ic and/or digital instrumentation. This hypotheses could be tested by testing albums from both playlist that have outlier scores for acousticness for that kind of instrumentation. A quick look into a small sample provides mixed results: out of the three 'least acoustic' tracks from the traditional playlist, only one (World in Union by the Soweto Gospel Choir) clearly uses synthesizers, while the other two (Mira Bhajan by Lakshmi Shankar and Ricky's White Face by Liz Carroll and John Doyle) seem to make use of acoustic instrumentation only. I can follow this up by a more in-depth look into acousticness.
