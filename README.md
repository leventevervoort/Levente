### World Music and the Grammy's
Since 1992, the Grammy for Best World Music Album is awarded. From 2004 to 2011 the Award was suspended and a Best Contemporary and Best Traditional Award were handed out instead. Every year, one winner was chosen out of five nominees. In 1997, six albums were nominated. In 2014, four albums were nominated and two albums won the Award ex aequo. I have created a playlist on Spotify that consists of all the nominated albums. In total, this amounts to 1094 songs divided among 111 albums.The Spotify URI for the playlist is: spotify:playlist:3F31WIjR3RI11VVTybMKOX

Three albums were completely unavailable, namely:

* King Sunny Adé - Odu (1999)
* Daniel Ho- On a Gentle Island Breeze (2012)
* Wu Man, Luis Conte & Daniel Ho – Our World in Song (2015)

Some albums were only available in parts. Songs from these albums were loaded into the playlist by Spotify from the respective artists' other album. I will need to consider how to deal with this once I start analyzing the data.

I also created a playlist that contains the nominees for Best Contemporary World Music Album, that consists of 36 albums and a total of 536 tracks. The Spotify URI for this playlist is spotify:playlist:2D5oiBpDIHydwu3CD2RLmg

Four albums were unavailable on Spotify, to wit:

* Youssou N'Dour - Nothing's in Vain (Coono du Reer) (2004)
* Bela Fleck - 	Throw Down Your Heart: Tales from the Acoustic Planet, Vol. 3 - Africa Sessions (2010)
* Omar Sosa - Across the Divide: A Tale of Rhythm & Ancestry (2010)

A third playlist contains the nominees for Best Traditional World Music Album, it contains 36 albums and 377 tracks.

These albums were unavailable:

* Perú Negro - Jolgorio (2005)
* Masters of Persian Music - Faryad (2006)
* John Santos Y El Coro Folklórico - La Guerra No (2010)
* Ten Drum Art Percussion Group - Drum Music Land (2010)

'World music' is a highly problematic genre label. It is an  umbrella term used primarily by the capitalist music industry to commodify a variety of musical styles and crossovers that are exoticized as non-traditional, folk, ethnic, indigenous or otherwise Other to Western popular music.
