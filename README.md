Since 1992, the Grammy for Best World Music Album is awarded. From 2004 to 2011 the Award was suspended and a Best Contemporary and Best Traditional Award were handed out instead. Every year, one winner was chosen out of five nominees. In 1997, six albums were nominated. In 2014, four albums were nominated and two albums won the Award ex aequo. I have created a playlist on Spotify that consists of all the nominated albums. The Spotify URI for the playlist is: spotify:playlist:3F31WIjR3RI11VVTybMKOX

Eight albums were unavailable, namely:
Dori Caymmi - Brazilian Serenata (1992)
King Sunny Adé - Odu (1999)
Salif Keita - Papa (2000) and Moffou (2003)
Gilberto Gil and Milton Nascimento - Gil and Milton (2001)
Daniel Ho- On a Gentle Island Breeze (2012)
Hugh Masekela - Jabulani (2012)
Femi Kuti - No Place for My Dream (2012)
Wu Man, Luis Conte & Daniel Ho – Our World in Song (2015)

In total, this amounts to 1094 songs divided among 105 albums.

'World music' is a highly problematic genre label that is an  umbrella term used primarily by the capitalist music industry to commodify a variety of musical styles and crossovers that are exoticized as non-traditional, folk, ethnic, indigenous or otherwise Other to Western popular music.
